# Add a new API spec and invoke an existing REST service
Duration: 10 mins  
Skill level: Beginner  


### Objective
This tutorial is to help you get started quickly with **API Connect**. We'll start by creating a new OpenAPI spec, and then proxy existing REST services used by the sample weather app.

---


### Explore the sample app and test the target endpoints
A sample _weather provider_ app has been created for this tutorial
1. Explore this app here: http://gettingstartedweatherapp.mybluemix.net/.
2. Enter a valid 5-digit US zipcode to get the _**current weather**_ and _**today's forecast**_.

3. Use this endpoint to get the **current** weather data:     _**https:// myweatherprovider<span></span>.mybluemix.net/current?zipcode={zipcode}**_.
 
- Test it out by clicking: https://myweatherprovider.mybluemix.net/current?zipcode=90210.

5. Use this endpoint to get **today's** forecast data:  
   _**https:// myweatherprovider<span></span>.mybluemix.net/today?zipcode={zipcode}**_.

- Test it out by clicking: https://myweatherprovider.mybluemix.net/today?zipcode=90210.

### Add a new OpenAPI spec and invoke an existing REST service
1. Log in to IBM Bluemix: https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/login.
2. In the Bluemix navigation panel on the left, select **Services** and click **Dashboard**.
3. Launch the API Connect service.
4. In API Connect, go to **Drafts > APIs**.
5. In the New API pop-up, enter "Weather Provider API" for the title.
_The Name and Base Path are auto-populated_  
6. Select **Create API** to complete the wizard.

7. Once your API is created, you are taken to the **Design** tab.
- Scroll down to the **Host** panel, and note the value that's filled in: ```$(catalog.host)```.
- In the **Base Path** panel, note the auto-populated value: ```/weather-provider-api```
- Your API's target URL will be created from these values

8. Scroll down to the **Security** tab, and delete the "clientIDHeader (API Key)" that has been been auto-generated. 
_We'll visit security with API Keys in the next tutorial_  


9. Scroll down to the **Paths** panel to create a new path.
  - Name it "**/current**".
  - In the same **Paths** panel, click on the **GET /current** section.
  - Add a new Parameter
    - Name: zipcode
    - Located in: Query
    - Required: Yes (check mark)
    - Type: string
  - Save your API, and scroll down to the **Definitions** panel

10. In the **Definitions** panel, add a new definition.
- Name: Current  /  Type: Object
- Add new properties for the **Current** definition
- Name: zip         /  Type: string
- Name: temperature /  Type: integer
- Name: humidity    /  Type: integer
- Name: city        /  Type: string
- Name: state       /  Type: string
- Save your API.

10. Scroll back up to the **Paths** panel.
- Open the **GET /current** operation, and scroll to the **Responses** section.
- Change the schema of the 200OK response from "object" to "**Current**".
- Save your API.
- The path and operation you created was to get the current weather data. Next you'll need to create the same to get today's weather data.  

11. Create a new path: **/today**.
    - Add a new Parameter under the **GET /today** operation
      - Parameter Name: zipcode
      - Located in: Query
      - Required: Yes (check mark)
      - Type: string

12. Create a new definition: **Today**
- Add new properties for the **Today** definition
  - Name: zip / Type: string
  - Name: hi / Type: integer
  - Name: lo / Type: integer
  - Name: nightHumidity / Type: integer
  - Name: dayHumidity / Type: integer
  - Name: city / Type: string
  - Name: state / Type: string
- Update the response schema in the **GET /today** section to "Today".
- Save your API.

13. Switch over to the **Assemble** tab.
  -  You've got two operations so far: **GET /current** and **GET /today**. To ensure the right target endpoint is invoked, you'll need to create some logic that will execute conditional on the operation that's being called. Let's use the **Operation Switch** logic construct to do this.
  a. First, delete the **invoke** policy that may already be added to the _canvas_
  b. Then, from the _palette_, drag the **Operation Switch** and drop it on the canvas
    - To **case 0**, assign the **get /current** operation
    - Add a new Case -- **case 1**
    - To **case 1**, assign the **get /today** operation
  c. The **Operation Switch**  provides a decision point -- based on the verb/path pair, the appropriate operation needs to be invoked.
  d. Drag the **invoke** policy from the _palette_ and drop it on the canvas; drop one in the **/get current** path, and one in the **/get today** path
    - Select the **invoke** policy in the **/get current** path, and update its title to "**invoke-current**"
    - Update the URL field with https://myweatherprovider.mybluemix.net/current?zipcode={zipcode}  
    - Select the **invoke** policy in the **/get today** path, and update its title to "**invoke-today**"
    - Update the URL field with https://myweatherprovider.mybluemix.net/today?zipcode={zipcode}  
  e. Save your API

### Test your API proxy
1. In the **Assemble** tab, click **More Actions > Generate a default product**.

2. Accept the default options in the **New Product** dialog popup, and click **Create Product**. The **Weather Provider API product** is created and published to the Sandbox catalog
  - _In API Connect, **Products** provide a mechanism to group APIs that intended for a particular use. Products are published to a **Catalog**. [Reference: API Connect glossary]_

3. Save and click â–º to test the API service. 

4. Choose the newly created default product, and the **get /current** operation
  - Zipcode is a required parameter for this operation, so enter a valid US zip (e.g. 90210).
  - Click **invoke**, and verify that you see:
    - 200 OK response
    - current weather data for 90210
